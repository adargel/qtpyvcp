class Drill(BaseGenerator):
    """This class generates GCode for drilling/tapping cycles.

    The canned drilling cycles G81 (drill), G74 (left hand tap),
    G84 (right hand tap), G82 (dwell), G83 (peck), and G73
    (chip-breaking), are all supported.

    The tapping cycle is intended for tapping with a floating chuck
    and dwell at the bottom of the hole.

    Tapping cycles will automatically set the z feed based on the
    given spindle RPM (speed), and thread pitch (1/TPI). If the
    spindle RPM is positive, a right hand tapping operation (G84)
    will be performed. If the spindle RPM is negative, a left hand
    tapping operation (G74) will be performed.

    The bolt_hole_circle_xy method will add the x, y positions for
    a bolt hole circle. Starting at the given angle, it will calculate
    the x, y positions along a circle of a given diameter for the number
    of holes specified and add them to the list of hole locations.

    After the bolt hole locations have been added, you can elect to run
    a drill, tap, peck, dwell, or chip-breaking cycle.

    Example:
        # This example is for demonstration purposes only and should not be
        # run on your CNC machine.
